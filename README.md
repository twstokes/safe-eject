#### Ideas:  

* Option to ignore certain drives
* Needs to be button, not a switch
* Color determines if it's safe to eject or not
* Pulsates when trying to eject devices

#### Arduino really only needs three states:

* Green (safe)
* Red (unsafe)
* Pulsating (working)

#### Todo:

* Clean up multiple calls about the same volume (includes slices)
